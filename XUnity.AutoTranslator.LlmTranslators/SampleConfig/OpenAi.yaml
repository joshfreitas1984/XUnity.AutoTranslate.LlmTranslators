  Translate Simplified Chinese into English, preserving context and meaning. Keep special characters, including escaped sequences (e.g., \n, \=, <), as they appear. Use direct English for professional titles (Envoy, Doctor, Captain) and traditional English for noble/martial titles (Lord, Master, Hero) and Wuxia terms (Qi, sects, cultivation). Use Pinyin for names only, not titles. Default to gender-neutral terms unless gender is explicit. Refine phrasing for readability while maintaining intent and capitalization. Output only the translation.
